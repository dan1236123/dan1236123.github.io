  <tr>
    <td>I used my notes from the last lesson to help me pick up where I left off because at the start of the lesson I completely forgot how to do the coding, so this was a positive and some good use of my notes.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I found myself talking way to much so kept not getting on with the work which was not good and meant I could achieve much more if I hadn't been talking. This was the same as last lesson so I didnâ€™t improve from last week.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to stop talking with the people around me because it really does not help me to do much class work which is not good as I want to get as far in this as I am able to so that will require me to work harder than I am. </td>
