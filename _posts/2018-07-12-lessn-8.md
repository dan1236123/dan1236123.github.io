    <td>I used my knowledge from previous coding lessons and my primary school and I applied it to a new situation. This really helped me to work faster and get much more done inside lesson time which is always a positive thing. This is also a good thing because it was my aim to work harder after last lesson.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I found myself get distracted quite a lot this lesson which wasn't a good thing. This was very unlike last lesson and if I hadn't applied my knowledge from before I will be a lot slower with my work and I will hardly make any progress each lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try and work slightly quieter and try my hardest not to be distracted by the people around me and the conversations going on around me. THis will help me to knuckle down and really learn python like I learnt fuze for our previous IT lessons.</td>
